# üç¨ Kata Sweet Shop
A Spring Boot-based application for managing a sweet shop's inventory. This project demonstrates a clean backend design, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and integration with Cloudinary for image uploads.

-----

## üìñ Project Overview

This is a demo inventory management system with the following features:

  * **Add sweets:** Include details like name, category, price, quantity, and an image.
  * **Image Uploads:** Images are uploaded via multipart requests and stored in Cloudinary.
  * **Purchase sweets:** With stock validation to ensure availability.
  * **Error Handling:** Meaningful error handling for insufficient stock or missing fields.

The project is built to showcase the Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor cycles of TDD, clean coding practices, and AI-assisted development.

-----

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

  * **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java 21)
  * **Database:** PostgreSQL
  * **ORM:** Hibernate / JPA
  * **Image Uploads:** Cloudinary
  * **Build Tool:** Maven
  * **Testing:** JUnit 5, Mockito, Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1\. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/kata-sweet-shop.git
cd kata-sweet-shop
```

### 2\. Configure Environment

Set up a `application.properties` file with your database and Cloudinary credentials:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/sweetshop
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=postgres

cloudinary.cloud-name=your-cloud-name
cloudinary.api-key=your-api-key
cloudinary.api-secret=your-api-secret
```

### 3\. Run the Application

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### 4\. Run Tests

```bash
./mvnw test
```

-----

## üß™ Test Report

The project follows TDD principles with unit and integration tests. Example test cases include:

  * ‚úÖ Purchasing sweets reduces stock.
  * ‚úÖ Purchasing with insufficient stock throws `InsufficientStockException`.
  * ‚úÖ Creating sweets with image URLs works.
  * ‚úÖ Creating sweets without required fields fails validation.
  * ‚úÖ Multipart image upload endpoint works with mocked Cloudinary.

Run the test suite with:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

## ü§ñ My AI Usage

I used AI tools responsibly during development.

### Tools Used

  * **ChatGPT:** Helped with TDD workflow (writing Red-Green-Refactor commit messages, generating validation logic, debugging test failures).
  * **GitHub Copilot:** Assisted in generating boilerplate code (DTOs, repository interfaces, test scaffolding).
  * **Gemini:** Brainstormed API endpoint structures and helped refine database schema design.

### How I Used Them

  * I used ChatGPT to draft commit messages in the TDD cycle (Red-Green-Refactor), and for explanations when test failures occurred.
  * I used Copilot inside IntelliJ for writing repetitive code (entity mappings, getter/setters, and mock setup in tests).
  * I used Gemini early on to outline endpoints and service responsibilities before implementation.

AI tools significantly improved my workflow by:

  * Reducing time spent on boilerplate and setup.
  * Helping me debug faster with clear explanations.
  * Encouraging better discipline with TDD by structuring tests before writing logic.

However, I carefully reviewed every suggestion, ensuring it aligned with clean coding practices and project requirements. AI served as a pair programmer, not a replacement for my reasoning.
